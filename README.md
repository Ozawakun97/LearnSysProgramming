# Learn System Programming with C language
This repo is about the code practice for learning system programming
,it includes File IO, Process Control, Inter Process Communication etc.

+ `main.cpp` and `copy.cpp` is about File IO
+ `select.cpp` is about File IO Control using `select()` function
+ `run.cpp` is about Process Control using `fork()` function and `excelp()` function.
+ `shm.cpp`,`shm_1.cpp` and `shm_mutex.cpp` is about Shared Memory using `shmget()` ,`shmat()` function,and 
especially `shm_mutex.cpp` introduces mutex on process control
+ `popen.cpp` and `poen_2.cpp` are about Pipe, where `popen_2.cpp` implements the `popen()` function
